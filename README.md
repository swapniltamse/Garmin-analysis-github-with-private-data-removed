This is a quick and dirty visualization of my heart rate abnormalities during my sick week this week.

Garmin is pretty bad with how they show their daily breakdowns when we move to a weekly view.
Also it does not allow exporting heart rate date from their website.

So this code should be able to help us to get heart rate and other data using Garmin API.
I have set it up for 7 days with 12 hour interval. Please customize it as needed.
