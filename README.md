This is a quick and dirty visualization of my heart rate abnormalities during my week's sick week.

Garmin is pretty bad with how they show their daily breakdowns when we move to a weekly view.
Also, it does not allow the export of heart rate data from the website.

So this code should help us get heart rate and other data using Garmin API.
I have set it up for 7 days with 12-hour intervals. Please customize it as needed.
